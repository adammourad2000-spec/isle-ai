# THE OPPORTUNITY

## The Cayman Islands Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Digital Tourism | Wealth Intelligence |
|------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Monaco | Basic website | Manual concierge |
| Dubai | Good apps | No AI profiling |
| Singapore | Strong digital | Business-focused |
| Maldives | Resort-specific | Fragmented |
| **Cayman Islands + Isle AI** | **AI-First** | **Automated HNWI detection** |

## The Gap

- **250,000+** annual visitors to the Cayman Islands
- **Unknown**: How many are HNWI/UHNWI?
- **Unknown**: What do they want?
- **Unknown**: Which businesses should serve them?
- **Lost Revenue**: High-value visitors not connected to premium services

```
VISITOR ARRIVES
      ↓
