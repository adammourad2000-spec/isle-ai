## Your Pitch (Keep It Simple)

> "I've built a working AI concierge for visitors to the Cayman Islands. It answers questions about hotels, restaurants, activities, and VIP services using real local data. It's live and ready to deploy on your tourism website. I'm offering the government first access before licensing to other Caribbean nations."

---

## Negotiation Anchors

| If they say... | You say... |
|----------------|------------|
| "Too expensive" | "A custom build would cost $250K+ and take 12 months" |
| "We need RFP" | "Happy to participate. Here's a pilot at no cost for 60 days" |
| "We'll build it ourselves" | "This took 6 months and integrates Claude AI + Google Places. Your team would need 12-18 months" |
| "Can you do $30K?" | "I can do $45K license + $12K/year support" |

---

## Minimum Walk-Away Price

**Don't go below $40,000 total first year.**

You built something real. Cayman can afford it. If they lowball you, license it to Bahamas, Turks & Caicos, or Bermuda instead.

---

## Alternative Markets (If Cayman Passes)

| Territory | Tourism Revenue | Contact |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| Bahamas | $3.5B/year | Bahamas Ministry of Tourism |
| Turks & Caicos | $1B/year | TCI Tourist Board |
| Bermuda | $500M/year | Bermuda Tourism Authority |
| BVI | $400M/year | BVI Tourist Board |
| USVI | $1.2B/year | USVI Dept of Tourism |

Same product, swap the data. Each is a $50K+ opportunity.
